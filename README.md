# Recommendor-System
 A recommender system is an AI-driven tool that suggests relevant items, such as products, content, or services, to users based on their preferences, behavior, or similarities with other users. It uses algorithms like collaborative filtering, which finds patterns in user interactions, and content-based filtering, which analyzes item features.
